      I got into coding through a mix of side projects and spending time working
      alongside developers, product managers, and data analytics teams. Being
      part of those conversations and seeing how things were built made me want
      to try it for myself — and what started as curiosity just stuck.

      Recently, I've been working on features like payment flows in a
      subscriptions app, originally built to help troubleshoot API integration
      issues for merchants at work. I’ve also been building an interactive map
      site for a separate project, which came out of a personal interest in
      gardening and a lack of existing resources. It’s turned into a way to
      combine tech with something more community-focused.

      Outside of work, I enjoy playing guitar and gardening in my small urban
      courtyard. This site is a showcase of some projects I've built — mostly
      using React, Node, MongoDB, and Tailwind CSS.
